## エラー
```
Poetry (2.1.1) is installed now. Great!

You can test that everything is set up by executing:

`poetry --version`

Configuring poetry to behave properly with asdf ...
Running: "poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true".


Setting virtualenvs.prefer-active-python does not exist

Cleanup: Something went wrong!
```
